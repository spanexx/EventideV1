/**
 * MIGRATION STATUS: Phase 3 Complete + Bug Fixes
 * 
 * ✅ Created signal-based services:
 * - PendingChangesSignalService
 * - UndoRedoSignalService
 * 
 * ✅ Updated AvailabilityComponent:
 * - Switched to signal-based pending changes tracking
 * - Switched to signal-based undo/redo operations
 * - Removed manual change detection subscriptions
 * - Eliminated manual state properties
 * 
 * ✅ Updated AvailabilityHeaderComponent:
 * - Added computed signals for reactive state
 * - Direct injection of signal services
 * - Removed @Input() bindings for state
 * 
 * ✅ Updated Templates:
 * - Header template uses signal syntax: `pendingChangesCount()`
 * - Parent template removes state input bindings
 * - Automatic reactivity without manual subscriptions
 * 
 * ✅ Fixed Angular Injection Context Issues:
 * - Moved toObservable() calls to constructors
 * - Fixed NG0203 runtime error
 * - Proper Observable compatibility layer
 * 
 * 🏁 Next Steps:
 * 1. Test undo/redo functionality thoroughly
 * 2. Update other dependent services (AvailabilityPendingChangesService, etc.)
 * 3. Remove old BehaviorSubject-based services
 * 4. Clean up old imports and dependencies
 * 
 * ✅ Key Improvements Achieved:
 * - Eliminated manual change detection calls
 * - Automatic computed state derivation
 * - Synchronous undo/redo operations
 * - Reduced component complexity
 * - Better performance with fine-grained reactivity
 * - Proper Angular injection context handling
