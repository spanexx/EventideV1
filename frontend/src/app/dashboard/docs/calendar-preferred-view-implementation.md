## Calendar Preferred View State Management - Summary

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive preferred view state management system for the calendar component. Here's what has been implemented:

### Key Components Created/Enhanced:

1. **CalendarPreferencesSignalService** - Signal-based service for reactive preferences management
2. **CalendarStateCoordinatorService** - Coordinates between state and preferences
3. **CalendarInitializationService** - Handles app-level initialization
4. **Enhanced CalendarStateService** - Integrates with both NgRx state and signal-based preferences

### Features Implemented:

#### 1. **Persistent Preferences Storage**
- User preferences are saved to localStorage as JSON
- Preferences include: defaultView, autoSwitchView, rememberLastView, smartRecommendations
- Automatic loading on service initialization

#### 2. **State Management Integration**
- NgRx state tracks both currentView and preferredView
- Effects handle preference loading and saving with error handling
- Reducers update both current and preferred views appropriately

#### 3. **Reactive View Synchronization** 
- Signal-based preferences provide fine-grained reactivity
- View changes are automatically saved as preferences when "rememberLastView" is enabled
- Smart view recommendations can be auto-applied when "autoSwitchView" is enabled

#### 4. **Calendar Integration**
- FullCalendar initialView is set from user preferences
- Dynamic view changes update both calendar and preferences
- Preferred view is applied after calendar initialization

### Implementation Details:

#### **LocalStorage Structure:**
```json
{
  "defaultView": "dayGridMonth",
  "autoSwitchView": false, 
  "rememberLastView": true,
  "smartRecommendations": true
}
```

#### **State Flow:**
1. App loads → CalendarInitializationService initializes preferences
2. Preferences loaded from localStorage → Signal service updates
3. NgRx effects load preferences into state
4. Calendar component uses preferred view for initialization
5. User changes view → Both state and preferences updated
6. Navigation/refresh → Preferred view restored

#### **Error Handling:**
- localStorage failures fall back to defaults
- Invalid preference values are sanitized
- State loading errors are logged and handled gracefully

### Files Modified/Created:

**New Services:**
- `calendar-preferences-signal.service.ts` - Signal-based preferences
- `calendar-state-coordinator.service.ts` - State coordination
- `calendar-initialization.service.ts` - App initialization

**Enhanced Files:**
- `calendar-state.service.ts` - Added preferences integration
- `calendar.effects.ts` - Added preference loading/saving effects
- `calendar.service.ts` - Added initialView parameter support
- `availability.component.ts` - Integrated preferred view loading
- `app.ts` - Added calendar system initialization

**State Management:**
- `calendar.models.ts` - Added CalendarPreferences interface
- `calendar.actions.ts` - Added preference actions
- `calendar.reducer.ts` - Added preference state handling
- `calendar.selectors.ts` - Added preference selectors

### Key Benefits:

1. **User Experience** - View preference persists across sessions
2. **Performance** - Signal-based reactivity for efficient updates
3. **Flexibility** - Multiple preference options (remember last view, auto-switch, etc.)
4. **Maintainability** - Clean separation of concerns with coordinator pattern
5. **Future-Ready** - Prepared for user settings UI implementation

The system is now ready for the user settings implementation you mentioned, providing a solid foundation for managing calendar preferences across the application.
