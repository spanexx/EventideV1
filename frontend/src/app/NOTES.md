 * FIXED MatDatepicker Error
 * 
 * Issue: MatDatepicker components were throwing an error because no DateAdapter provider was found.
 * 
 * Solution: Added provideNativeDateAdapter() to:
 * 1. app.config.ts (global provider)
 * 2. analytics.module.ts (module-specific provider)
 * 
 * This provides the necessary DateAdapter implementation for Material datepickers to work properly.
 * 
 * Components using MatDatepicker:
 * - analytics/pages/analytics-dashboard/analytics-dashboard.component.ts
 * - analytics/pages/reports/reports.component.ts
 * 
 * FIXED NgRx Store Selector Error
 * 
 * Issue: Selectors were trying to access the "analytics" feature state before it was initialized,
 * causing "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors.
 * 
 * Solution: 
 * 1. Updated analytics selectors to handle undefined state by adding null checks.
 * 2. Converted analytics components from standalone to module-based components to ensure
 *    the analytics feature state is properly loaded when the components are accessed.
 * 3. Converted the AnalyticsComponent from standalone to a module-based component.
 *
