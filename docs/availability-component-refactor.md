# Availability Component Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The availability component has been refactored to improve code organization, readability, and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality. The refactoring focused on extracting complex logic into smaller, more manageable methods and improving the overall structure of the component.

## Refactoring Improvements

### 1. Calendar Initialization Logic
**Before:** Calendar options were defined directly in the property declaration
**After:** Extracted calendar initialization into a dedicated method `initializeCalendarOptions()`

```typescript
// Before
calendarOptions: CalendarOptions = {
  // All calendar configuration inline
};

// After
calendarOptions: CalendarOptions = this.initializeCalendarOptions();

private initializeCalendarOptions(): CalendarOptions {
  return {
    // All calendar configuration in separate method
  };
}
```

### 2. Event Handling Methods
**Before:** `handleEventResize` and `handleEventDrop` had duplicated logging code
**After:** Extracted common logic into `handleCalendarEvent` helper method

```typescript
// Before - duplicated logging in both methods
handleEventResize(resizeInfo: any) {
  // Log performance metrics
  if (this.performanceLoggingEnabled) {
    console.log('[Performance] Handling event resize in AvailabilityComponent', {
      eventId: resizeInfo.event.id,
      start: resizeInfo.event.start,
      end: resizeInfo.event.end
    });
  }
  // Handle event resize
  this.eventHandlingService.handleEventResize(/*...*/);
}

// After - common logic extracted
handleEventResize(resizeInfo: any) {
  this.handleCalendarEvent('resize', resizeInfo, (info) => 
    this.eventHandlingService.handleEventResize(info, this.availability$, calculateDurationInMinutes)
  );
}

private handleCalendarEvent(
  eventType: string, 
  eventInfo: any, 
  handler: (info: any) => void
): void {
  // Log performance metrics
  if (this.performanceLoggingEnabled) {
    console.log(`[Performance] Handling event ${eventType} in AvailabilityComponent`, {
      eventId: eventInfo.event.id,
      start: eventInfo.event.start,
      end: eventInfo.event.end
    });
  }
  
  // Handle the event
  handler(eventInfo);
}
```

### 3. Calendar Update Logic
**Before:** Complex calendar update logic was inline in the availability subscription
**After:** Extracted into multiple focused methods for better readability

```typescript
// Before - complex inline logic
this.availability$.subscribe(availability => {
  // Complex logic for determining update type and updating calendar
});

// After - extracted into focused methods
this.availability$.subscribe(availability => {
  this.updateCalendarWithAvailability(availability, previousAvailability);
});

private updateCalendarWithAvailability(
  availability: Availability[], 
  previousAvailability: Availability[]
): void {
  // Logic for determining update type
}

private refreshFullCalendar(availability: Availability[]): void {
  // Logic for full calendar refresh
}

private updateSingleCalendarEvent(updatedSlot: Availability): void {
  // Logic for updating single event
}
```

### 4. Context Menu Handling
**Before:** Context menu logic was directly in `showContextMenu` method
**After:** Extracted positioning logic into `openContextMenuAtPosition` method

```typescript
// Before
showContextMenu(event: MouseEvent) {
  // All logic including positioning
}

// After
showContextMenu(event: MouseEvent) {
  // Just prevent default and set position
  this.openContextMenuAtPosition(event);
}

private openContextMenuAtPosition(event: MouseEvent): void {
  // Positioning logic
}
```

### 5. Keyboard Event Handling
**Before:** All keyboard shortcut handling was in a single large method
**After:** Extracted shortcut handling into `handleKeyboardShortcut` and specific shortcut methods

```typescript
// Before
@HostListener('window:keydown', ['$event'])
handleKeyboardEvent(event: KeyboardEvent) {
  // All keyboard shortcut handling logic
}

// After
@HostListener('window:keydown', ['$event'])
handleKeyboardEvent(event: KeyboardEvent) {
  // Just check if calendar is focused
  this.handleKeyboardShortcut(event);
}

private handleKeyboardShortcut(event: KeyboardEvent): void {
  // Shortcut handling logic
}

private handleAddAvailabilityShortcut(): void {
  // Specific logic for add availability shortcut
}
```

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Readability:** Each method now has a single responsibility and is easier to understand
2. **Better Maintainability:** Changes to specific functionality can be made in isolated methods
3. **Reduced Code Duplication:** Common logic is now shared through helper methods
4. **Enhanced Testability:** Smaller methods are easier to unit test
5. **Easier Debugging:** Issues can be traced to specific methods more easily

## Testing
All existing functionality has been preserved and thoroughly tested to ensure:
- Drag-to-resize operations work correctly
- Drag-to-move operations work correctly
- Calendar updates are efficient
- All keyboard shortcuts function properly
- Context menu appears in correct position
- History management works as expected

The refactored component maintains the same public API and behavior while significantly improving the internal structure and code quality.
