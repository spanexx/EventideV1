# Secure Booking Cancellation Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a two-step email verification process for booking cancellations to prevent unauthorized cancellations.

## âœ… Completed Backend Implementation

### 1. DTOs Created
- **`request-cancellation.dto.ts`** - Validates booking ID and guest email
- **`verify-cancellation.dto.ts`** - Validates booking ID, email, and 6-digit code

### 2. Services Created
- **`booking-cancellation.service.ts`**
  - Generates 6-digit verification codes
  - Stores codes in memory with 15-minute expiration
  - Limits to 3 verification attempts
  - Handles code verification and booking cancellation
  - Auto-cleanup of expired codes

### 3. Email Notifications Added
- **`sendCancellationCode()`** - Sends verification code email
- **`sendCancellationConfirmation()`** - Sends cancellation confirmation email

### 4. API Endpoints Added
- **POST `/bookings/cancel/request`** - Request cancellation (sends code)
- **POST `/bookings/cancel/verify`** - Verify code and cancel booking

### 5. Module Registration
- Added `BookingCancellationService` to `booking.module.ts`

## âœ… Completed Frontend Implementation

### 1. Component Created
- **`booking-cancellation.component.ts`**
  - Two-step stepper UI
  - Email verification step
  - Code verification step
  - Success/error handling
  - Auto-redirect after success

### 2. Template & Styles
- **`booking-cancellation.component.html`** - Material Design stepper UI
- **`booking-cancellation.component.scss`** - Responsive styling

### 3. Service Methods Added (Partial)
- Updated `booking-facade.service.ts` with cancellation methods
- Updated `booking-operations.service.ts` with cancellation logic

## ðŸ”„ Remaining Tasks

### Backend
1. âœ… All backend tasks completed

### Frontend
1. **Add API methods to `booking-api.service.ts`**:
   ```typescript
   requestCancellation(bookingId: string, guestEmail: string): Observable<{ message: string }> {
     return this.http.post<{ message: string }>(`${this.apiUrl}/cancel/request`, {
       bookingId,
       guestEmail
     });
   }

   verifyCancellation(bookingId: string, guestEmail: string, verificationCode: string): Observable<{ message: string; booking: Booking }> {
     return this.http.post<{ message: string; booking: Booking }>(`${this.apiUrl}/cancel/verify`, {
       bookingId,
       guestEmail,
       verificationCode
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Add route to `app.routes.ts`**:
   ```typescript
   {
     path: 'booking-cancel/:id',
     loadComponent: () => import('./booking-cancellation/booking-cancellation.component')
       .then(m => m.BookingCancellationComponent)
   }
   ```

3. **Update `booking-lookup.component.ts`** - Replace direct cancellation with navigation:
   ```typescript
   cancelBooking(booking: Booking): void {
     if (!booking || (!booking._id && !booking.id)) return;
     
     const bookingId = booking._id || booking.id || '';
     // Navigate to secure cancellation page
     this.router.navigate(['/booking-cancel', bookingId], {
       state: { serialKey: booking.serialKey }
     });
   }
   ```

4. **Update `booking-lookup.component.html`** - Update cancel button text:
   ```html
   <button 
     mat-raised-button 
     color="warn" 
     (click)="cancelBooking(booking)"
     *ngIf="canCancel(booking)">
     <mat-icon>cancel</mat-icon>
     Request Cancellation
   </button>
   ```

## Security Features

### Backend Security
- âœ… Email verification required
- âœ… 6-digit random code generation
- âœ… 15-minute code expiration
- âœ… Maximum 3 verification attempts
- âœ… Automatic cleanup of expired codes
- âœ… Booking status validation (can't cancel completed/already cancelled)

### Frontend Security
- âœ… Two-step verification process
- âœ… Email confirmation before code sent
- âœ… Code input validation (6 digits only)
- âœ… Clear error messages
- âœ… Resend code functionality
- âœ… Auto-redirect after success

## User Flow

1. **User clicks "Request Cancellation"** on booking details
2. **Redirected to cancellation page** with booking ID
3. **Step 1: Enter email** - User enters their email address
4. **System sends verification code** - 6-digit code sent to email
5. **Step 2: Enter code** - User enters the code from email
6. **System verifies code** - Validates code and cancels booking
7. **Confirmation** - Success message shown, confirmation email sent
8. **Auto-redirect** - Returns to booking lookup after 3 seconds

## Email Templates

### Cancellation Code Email
- Subject: "Booking Cancellation - Verification Code"
- Contains: 6-digit code, expiry time (15 min), booking ID
- Security note: "If you didn't request this, ignore this email"

### Cancellation Confirmation Email
- Subject: "Booking Cancellation Confirmed"
- Contains: Cancelled booking details, rebooking link
- Confirmation that cancellation was successful

## Testing Checklist

### Backend Tests
- [ ] Request cancellation with valid email
- [ ] Request cancellation with invalid email
- [ ] Request cancellation for already cancelled booking
- [ ] Verify with correct code
- [ ] Verify with incorrect code (3 attempts)
- [ ] Verify with expired code
- [ ] Code cleanup after expiration

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Navigate to cancellation page
- [ ] Email validation
- [ ] Code request flow
- [ ] Code verification flow
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Success flow and redirect
- [ ] Resend code functionality

## Notes

- Codes are stored in-memory (will be lost on server restart)
- For production, consider using Redis for code storage
- Email service must be properly configured
- Rate limiting should be added to prevent abuse
- Consider adding CAPTCHA for additional security

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining frontend tasks (API service, routes, component updates)
2. Test the complete flow end-to-end
3. Add unit tests for backend services
4. Add integration tests for API endpoints
5. Consider adding Redis for production code storage
6. Add rate limiting to cancellation endpoints
