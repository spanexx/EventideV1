# Availability Component Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This refactoring transforms the large, monolithic AvailabilityComponent into a more modular architecture by extracting functionality into specialized services. This approach follows the Single Responsibility Principle and improves maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Calendar Service
**File:** `calendar/calendar.service.ts`
- Extracted all calendar management functionality
- Handles FullCalendar API interactions
- Manages calendar initialization and updates
- Provides methods for updating single events or full calendar refresh

### 2. Created Calendar Events Service
**File:** `calendar/calendar-events.service.ts`
- Extracted all event handling logic
- Manages event click, resize, and drop operations
- Handles performance logging for events
- Centralizes event-related business logic

### 3. Simplified Main Component
**File:** `availability.component.new.ts`
- Reduced from ~500 lines to ~300 lines
- Delegates responsibilities to specialized services
- Maintains orchestration role
- Preserves all existing functionality

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Improved Maintainability
- Each service has a single responsibility
- Changes to calendar functionality only affect CalendarService
- Event handling logic is isolated in CalendarEventsService

### 2. Better Testability
- Services can be unit tested independently
- Mocking dependencies is easier
- Reduced coupling between components

### 3. Enhanced Readability
- Main component focuses on orchestration
- Complex logic is moved to appropriate services
- Method sizes are more manageable

### 4. Reusability
- Calendar services can be reused in other components
- Event handling logic is centralized
- Common functionality is easily accessible

## Files Created

1. `calendar/calendar.service.ts` - Manages calendar operations
2. `calendar/calendar-events.service.ts` - Handles event interactions
3. `availability.component.new.ts` - Simplified main component

## Migration Plan

1. Created backup of original component
2. Implemented new services and simplified component
3. Tested new implementation
4. Replace original component with refactored version
5. Remove backup after verification

## Testing Performed

- Verified all calendar operations work correctly
- Confirmed event handling functions as expected
- Checked that all keyboard shortcuts still work
- Ensured dialogs open and function properly
- Validated history/undo functionality

## Next Steps

1. Replace original component with refactored version
2. Update any imports or references
3. Perform thorough testing
4. Remove backup files after successful deployment
