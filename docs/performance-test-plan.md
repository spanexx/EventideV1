# Performance Test Plan for Availability Calendar Drag-to-Resize Operations

## Objective
Verify that the performance issues with drag-to-resize operations in the availability calendar have been resolved and that the system no longer hangs during these operations.

## Test Environment
- Development environment with local MongoDB instance
- Chrome browser (latest version)
- Standard development machine specifications

## Test Cases

### 1. Basic Drag-to-Resize Performance Test
**Description:** Test basic drag-to-resize functionality to ensure it responds quickly and doesn't cause system hangs.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the availability calendar page
2. Create a new availability slot if none exist
3. Click and drag the edge of an existing availability slot to resize it
4. Observe system responsiveness during the operation
5. Release the mouse button to complete the resize
6. Verify the slot has been resized correctly

**Expected Results:**
- Smooth resizing operation with no system hangs
- Immediate visual feedback during drag
- Successful resize completion within 1 second
- No browser tab freezing or unresponsiveness

### 2. Rapid Drag-to-Resize Test
**Description:** Test multiple rapid drag-to-resize operations to ensure system stability under stress.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the availability calendar page
2. Ensure at least 3 availability slots exist
3. Rapidly resize each slot 5 times in succession
4. Observe system responsiveness throughout the operations
5. Monitor browser console for any error messages
6. Verify all slots have been resized correctly

**Expected Results:**
- All resize operations complete successfully
- No system hangs or browser freezing
- Consistent performance across all operations
- No memory leaks or excessive resource consumption

### 3. Extended Drag-to-Resize Session Test
**Description:** Test prolonged drag-to-resize operations to ensure system stability over time.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the availability calendar page
2. Create 10 availability slots
3. Resize each slot continuously for 2 minutes
4. Observe system resource usage (CPU, memory)
5. Monitor browser performance and responsiveness
6. Verify all slots maintain their resized states

**Expected Results:**
- Stable system performance throughout the test
- Reasonable CPU and memory usage (under 80%)
- No browser tab crashes or hangs
- All slots maintain correct resized states

### 4. Concurrent Operations Test
**Description:** Test drag-to-resize operations while other actions are occurring.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the availability calendar page
2. Start resizing a slot
3. While dragging, simulate other user actions (e.g., clicking other UI elements)
4. Complete the resize operation
5. Verify both the resize and other actions completed successfully

**Expected Results:**
- Both operations complete successfully
- No interference between concurrent actions
- System remains responsive throughout

## Performance Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Response Time:** Drag-to-resize operations should complete within 500ms
- **Frame Rate:** UI updates should maintain at least 30 FPS during drag operations
- **Memory Usage:** Memory consumption should not increase by more than 10% during extended operations
- **CPU Usage:** CPU usage should not exceed 70% during drag operations

### Monitoring Tools
- Browser Developer Tools Performance tab
- Browser Developer Tools Memory tab
- System resource monitor

## Success Criteria
1. No system hangs or browser freezes during drag-to-resize operations
2. All drag-to-resize operations complete within 500ms
3. System resources remain stable during extended usage
4. No errors or warnings in browser console related to performance
5. User experience is smooth and responsive

## Rollback Plan
If performance issues persist:
1. Revert changes to event handling service
2. Revert changes to availability component
3. Revert changes to history management service
4. Revert changes to backend availability service
5. Notify development team for further investigation

## Test Execution Schedule
- Test execution: Immediate
- Results analysis: Within 1 hour of completion
- Final verification: After all fixes are implemented
