/*
You alreadyknow what MCP tools we have
You can use it when you need to espacially the memory tool and our task management tools, mongodb tools
and sequential thinking
just so you know you can get
backend logs : @backend/backend-logs/current.log
browser logs : @backend/browser-logs/current.log
use the tail command to get as many lines as you want to



check the @backend\browser-logs\current.log






at the @backend/src/auth
the Api expects a user to verify their email but there is no boolean to check if the user is verified or not
1st we need to update the user schema to include a boolean to check if the user is verified or not

then we need to update the auth/verify endpoint to update this enpoint when user do
lets update the signup effect to act as the API expects

if you look at the sign up api
@backend/src/auth
the user recieves an email to verify email

Lets route user to login page but before then we will inform user an email has been sent to them

my point is i need a perfect auth flow


how do i add a custom agent to zed
i want to add qwen code cli
you can make some research
below is what i see in the zed doc

Add Custom Agents
You can run any agent speaking ACP in Zed by changing your settings as follows:

{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Custom Agent": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["~/projects/agent/index.js", "--acp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
This can also be useful if you're in the middle of developing a new agent that speaks the protocol and you want to debug it.

You can also specify a custom path, arguments, or environment for the builtin integrations by using the claude and gemini names.
